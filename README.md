# [Giftastic](https://jaswhitehead.github.io/Giftastic/)
The purpose of this page is to harness the GIPHY API to make category buttons clickable that will return "still" .gif images in groups of 10. The user can then make each of the .gif's animated with a click of the mouse.

If the user chooses, they can even add a choice of their own to the category list and get 10 gifs of a chracter of their own choosing.

Pretty Cool Stuff!
